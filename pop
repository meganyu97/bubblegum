dear mr wrigley,

there are about two grams of sugar in a stick of bubblegum
but i'm sure you already knew that.

on average, people chew gum for about three minutes
before the two grams escape and begin exploring your bloodstream.
the sweetness only lasts so long before your jaw is simply
continuing the movement prompted by muscle memory.

i've tried therapists and meditation,
but no one's been through it all with me except you

bubblegum-flavored glasses, the simplicity of
youth and naïveté
the bigger the bubble the more inflated my ego
sometimes the chewing was obnoxious, i'll admit,
but the glares couldn't pierce my elastic xylitol walls

i was floating in my pink, perfect bubblegum world

when all of a sudden he popped it and walked away.

now i'm left with a sticky situation.
the american political system has yet to infiltrate the true secrets of civilian life
but, lo and behold, you've been doing it since 1891. 
thanks a lot, mr wrigley.
